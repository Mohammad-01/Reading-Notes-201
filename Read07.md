## What is HTML table tag?
* A Web page's HTML structure for constructing rows and columns. The Table tag specifies the overall table, whereas the Table Row (TR) tag specifies how each row is constructed. The real data is defined by the Table Data (TD) tag. Tables were commonly utilized for almost every element on the page prior to HTML5.

## Note 
* The table's data containers are the td> elements.
They can contain any HTML element, including text, graphics, lists, and other tables.

## What is constructor in JavaScript?
* Functions can be used as templates to create other objects in JavaScript. These functions are known as constructor functions, and they have unique qualities not seen in conventional functions.

## Why we use constructor function?
* A constructor method is a particular method of a class that is used to create and initialize objects of that class.

## How to call constructor in JavaScript?
* Constructors can only be called with the new keyword, and the new keyword can only be used to call constructors. Unfortunately, the situation is not as stringent with javascript. As a result, calling a function that isn't intended to be a constructor will not result in an error.

## Can Constructor be private?
* Yes. A private constructor is an option for a class. Private constructors can be found in even abstract classes. We prevent the class from being instantiated as well as subclassing by keeping the constructor secret.
