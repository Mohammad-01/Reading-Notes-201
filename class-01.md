### What's Markdown 
Markdown is a web-based text formatting system. You have complete control over how the document appears; bolding or italicizing phrases, inserting photos, and generating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Markdown is mostly simply plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or * tossed in for good measure.
### Markdown syntax examples that can use on GitHub or in text files
1. Headers
2. Emphasis 
3. Lists(Unordered & Ordered) 
4. Images
5. Links
6. Blockquotes
7. Inline code

## What's HTML?
* Hyper Text Markup is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading," "this is a paragraph," "this is a link," and so on. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages that describes the structure of a Web page. It consists of a series of elements, elements tell the browser how to display the content, and HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading," "this is a paragraph," "this is a link," and so on.

## What is the layout of HTML?
* An HTML layout is a set of instructions for arranging web pages in a specific order. It's simple to explore and understand, and it makes use of HTML tags to customize site design aspects. An HTML layout that uses the correct format is essential for every website and will readily improve its appearance.

## HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

## What's semantics in HTML
* Semantics is a term used in programming to describe the meaning of a piece of code, such as "what purpose or role does that HTML element have?"
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of information in webpages and web applications rather than simply defining its display or appearance, traditional web browsers, as well as a variety of other user agents, process semantic HTML.
  
## Markdown versus HTML
* Markdown is easier to write than HTML, and most people can read Markdown source more easily than HTML source. HTML, on the other hand, is more expressive (especially when it comes to semantic tagging) and may create some specialized effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve with Markdown.

## What's JavaScribt?
* JavaScript is an interpreted, lightweight programming language. It is intended for the development of network-centric applications. It works in tandem with and complements Java. Because JavaScript is interwoven with HTML, it is simple to use and It's free to use and cross-platform.

## What's the difference between HTML and JavaScript?
* HTML is a markup language as we say that provides the basic framework of a website, whereas JavaScript is a more advanced programming language for creating dynamic web pages. HTML is rendered entirely on the server, as opposed to client-side programming.
## Why we use HTML with JavaScript?
* JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.
## Where JavaScript is used in HTML?
* Between the <script> and </script> tags in HTML, JavaScript code is injectet in the end of HTML code at usual

## What Does Web Mean? 
* The World Wide Web, also known as the Web, is a subset of the Internet that consists of pages that may be viewed using a Web browser. Many individuals mistakenly believe that the Web and the Internet are the same thing and confuse the two. The term Internet, on the other hand, refers to the global network of servers that allows people to share information over the Internet. So, while the Web makes up a substantial part of the Internet, they are not the same thing.

## Explains Web
* Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to format web pages (HTML). This is the language that allows users to navigate through web pages by clicking on links. The HTTP protocol is used on the Web to convey data and distribute information. Web documents, or Web pages, are accessed via links using browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox.Information is shared through the Internet in a variety of ways, including email, instant chat, and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) (FTP).

## Design Process
* The Design Process is a method for breaking down a major project into smaller, more manageable pieces. The design process is used by architects, engineers, scientists, and other intellectuals to tackle a variety of challenges. Use this method to identify the stages required to complete each project, and remember to stick to your original ideas and sketches throughout.

## THE DESIGN PROCESS IS MADE UP OF SIX STEPS:
1. Identify the issue
You won't be able to find a solution until you know exactly what the problem is.

2. Gathering Information
Start by collecting sketches, images, and statistics to help you get ideas.

3. Generate and evaluate ideas
Start sketching, making, and studying so you can see how all of the facts and knowledge you've gathered might affect your design.

4. Come up with solutions
Create a number of small-scale design concepts based on your basic thoughts.
 
5. Collect feedback
Present your ideas to as many people as possible, including friends, instructors, experts, and anybody else you believe can provide meaningful feedback.


6. Enhance
Consider all of your suggestions and evaluate whether or not they should be implemented. Taking solutions back through the Design Process to enhance and explain them is frequently beneficial.
