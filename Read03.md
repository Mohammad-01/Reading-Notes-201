## What is the control flow?
* The sequence in which individual statements, commands, or function calls in an imperative program are performed or evaluated is known as control flow (or flow of control) in computer science. An imperative programming language is distinguished from a declarative programming language by its emphasis on explicit control flow.

## Why we need the control flow?
* Consider a script that is used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script uploads validated data, but if the user, for example, forgets to fill in a needed field, the script urges them to do so. The script accomplishes this by employing a conditional structure, also known as if...else, in which different code is executed depending on whether the form is completed or not.

## Example:
if (field==empty) {

    promptUser();  
} 

else {
  
    submitForm();
}

## In CSS, how do you construct a box model?
* When discussing design and layout in CSS, the term "box model" is used. The CSS box model consists of a box that wraps around each HTML element. It is made up of the following elements: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

## Parts of box model in CSS:

1- Content- The box's content, which includes text and photos

2- Padding- Creates a buffer zone around the content. The cushioning is made of translucent material.

3- Border- A border surrounding the padding and the content

4- Margin- Clears a space on the outskirts of the border. The margin is made of translucent material.

### Note: 
* The box model allows us to define space between elements and build a border around them.
