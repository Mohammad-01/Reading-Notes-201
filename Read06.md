## What is the prblem domain? 
* All information that identifies the problem and constrains the solution is referred to as the problem domain in engineering (the constraints being part of the problem). It contains the problem owner's desired outcomes, the context in which the problem occurs, and any rules defining vital functions or other characteristics of any solution product.
It depicts both the problem and the context in which a solution will have to work. The phrase "problem domain" refers to the area in which real-world objects and concepts relating to the problem that the system is being created to solve are included. The objective of domain modeling is to find "objects" (really classes) that represent those items and concepts.

## What are domains in software engineering?
* A domain is a computer program's specific topic area. It's a word used in the field of software development. Formally, it denotes the subject of a certain programming project, whether it is defined narrowly or broadly.

## What are objects in JS?
* JavaScript is based on a straightforward object-oriented paradigm. A property is an association between a name (or key) and a value, while an object is a collection of properties. The value of a property can be a function, in which case the property is referred to as a method. You can create your own objects in addition to those that are predefined in the browser.
This chapter explains how to work with objects, properties, functions, and methods, as well as how to make your own.

## JavaScript Objects: 

Almost "everything" in JavaScript is an object.

Objects can be Booleans (if defined with the new keyword)

Objects can be numbers (if defined with the new keyword)

Objects can be strings (if defined with the new keyword)

Dates are invariably objects.

Mathematical objects are constantly present.

Objects are always regular expressions.

Arrays are objects at all times.

Objects are always functions.

Objects, by definition, are always objects.

### Note: Except for primitives, all JavaScript values are objects.

## What is the 5 types of primitive data types in JS?

1- string

2- number

3- boolean

4- null

5- undefined

## How to create object in JavaScript?

You can define and create your own objects using JavaScript.

1- Using an object literal, create a single object.
2- With the keyword " new ", make a single object.
3- Create objects of the built type after defining an object constructor.
4- Using Object, make an " Object.create() "

## What is DOM?
* The Document Object Model (DOM) is an HTML and XML document programming interface. It depicts a page so that programs can alter the structure, style, and content of the document. The document is represented in the DOM via nodes and objects. Programming languages will be able to connect to the page in this manner.
A document is a Web page. This document can be viewed in a browser window or downloaded as an HTML source. In all circumstances, though, the document is the same. That same document is represented by the Document Object Model (DOM), which allows it to be edited. The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object-oriented representation of a web page that may be changed using a programming language like JavaScript.

## DOM Example:
* The following is an example of DOM modification using ECMAScript: var myTbodyElement = myTableElement; / access the tbody element from the table element. firstChild; / access the second tr element from the table element. / The number of children in the list starts at zero (and not 1).

## W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types

XML DOM - standard model for XML documents

HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

## What is the HTML DOM?

The HTML DOM is a programming interface and standard object model for HTML. It specifies:

As objects, HTML elements
All HTML elements have properties.
All HTML components can be accessed using the following techniques.
All HTML elements have their own set of events.

In other words, the HTML DOM is a set of rules for getting, changing, adding, and removing HTML elements.
